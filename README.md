# Dating Profile Predictions
This project is the culmination of an assignment aimed at exploring and analyzing dating profile data to uncover predictive insights.
The primary objective was to familiarize myself with the dataset, identify potential predictive tasks, and apply various machine learning techniques to achieve the best possible model.

I chose to predict user gender based on other features in the profile. For me this was most interesting feature to predict because I was pretty sure it can't be that hard. Guessing chance is already 50%.
After thorough experimentation, a Decision Tree algorithm emerged as the top performer, boasting an impressive prediction accuracy of 99%. I was prepaired to use XGBoost algorithm next but Decision three did the job.

## Overview
The exploration of dating profile data presented a unique opportunity to delve into personal attributes and preferences, aiming to discover patterns and predict outcomes based on profile features.
The task was open-ended, requiring an initial phase of data understanding and hypothesis generation about possible predictive tasks.
